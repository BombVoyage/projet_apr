# Deep Q learning model for Atari games

## Usage
After installing the requirements, simply run dql.py with the provided CLI:

`python dql.py -h`

For example: `python dql.py train breakout 2`

## Files
`dql.py` - main file containing all the code needed for training and testing a deep Q learning model

`atari_example.py` - code copied from the Keras documentation [here](https://keras.io/examples/rl/deep_q_network_breakout/), for learning and debugging purposes
